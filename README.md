This README provides a guide for setting up and using the Weather App, a web application that allows users to check the current weather conditions for a specific location.
Introduction
The Weather App is a simple web application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to fetch and display current weather data. It makes use of an external weather API to retrieve weather information based on user-provided location data.

Features
Current Weather: The app displays the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the weather.

Search Functionality: Users can enter the name of a city or location in the search bar and receive the latest weather information for that location.

Responsive Design: The app is designed to work smoothly on various screen sizes, including desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Setup
Follow these steps to set up the Weather App on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Web browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.)
Text editor or integrated development environment (IDE)

API Key:

The Weather App requires an API key to fetch weather data from a weather API. You can sign up for a free API key from Weather API Provider and replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' in the script.js file with your actual API key.

Open the App:

Open the cloned repository folder in your text editor or IDE. Locate the index.html file and open it in your web browser to run the Weather App.
